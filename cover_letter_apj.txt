Dear Dr. Steven Kawaler and Anonymous Referee,

    Thank you for the thorough read through and for the detailed list of changes for this work.
    
    
    Here we summarize the changes to our manuscript and respond to the referee's questions.
    
    > Perhaps this betrays my ignorance, but are these objects definitely brown dwarfs? As I understand it, a brown dwarf is a gas ball that is cooling via Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, but never begins nor sustains hydrogen fusion in their cores (which would make it a star). Stellar evolutionary models can make hydrogen-burning stars with mid-L spectral types. So, some L dwarfs are likely bona fide stars, and therefore not brown dwarfs. The transition from M to L is based on molecular lines seen in their spectra as a consequence of photospheric temperature, not whether they are burning hydrogen in their cores. 

    We have added 1 sentence justifications for each brown dwarf that they are likely below the hydrogen burning limit.
    
    We replaced our uses of "calibrator" and "comparison star" with reference star to be consistent.
    
    We labeled the target and reference stars in the 2MASS 3-color images to clarify which ones are used.
