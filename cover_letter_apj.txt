Dear Dr. Steven Kawaler and Anonymous Referee,

    Thank you to anonymous referee for the thorough and careful reading of this work as well as the many suggestions that improved paper's clarity.
    
    Here we summarize the changes to our manuscript and respond to the referee's questions.
    
    > Perhaps this betrays my ignorance, but are these objects definitely brown dwarfs? As I understand it, a brown dwarf is a gas ball that is cooling via Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, but never begins nor sustains hydrogen fusion in their cores (which would make it a star). Stellar evolutionary models can make hydrogen-burning stars with mid-L spectral types. So, some L dwarfs are likely bona fide stars, and therefore not brown dwarfs. The transition from M to L is based on molecular lines seen in their spectra as a consequence of photospheric temperature, not whether they are burning hydrogen in their cores. 

    We have added 1 sentence justifications for each brown dwarf that they are likely below the hydrogen burning limit.
    
    We replaced our uses of "calibrator" and "comparison star" with reference star to be consistent.
    
    We labeled the target and reference stars in the 2MASS 3-color images to clarify which ones are used.
    
    > "n=1.67 - 0.006 j COMPLEX index of refraction" add "complex" for clarity. And do people usually use j here instead of i?
    
    We have instead used n=1.67 and k=0.006, which is more consistent with the literature conventions.
    
    > Is there a reference for how the authors computed the brightness temperature (Equations 1 and 2)? I see they did not include limb-darkening in that calculation. If they are choosing to ignore limb-darkening, but other refereed literature takes the same approach, that's fine, just provide a citation and explain why they can ignore limb darkening.
    
    We calculate the brightness temperature with linear limb darkening in order to assess the accuracy of this assumption.
