\begin{abstract}
Low-temperature L dwarfs exhibit low-level, rotationally-modulated photometric variability generally associated with heterogeneous, cloud-covered atmospheres. The spectral character of these variations yield insight into the particle sizes and vertical structure of the clouds. Here we present the results of a high precision, ground-based, near-infrared, spectral monitoring study of two mid-type L dwarfs, 2MASS~J08354256$-$0819237 and 2MASS~J18212815+1414010, using the SpeX instrument on the Infrared Telescope Facility. By simultaneously observing a nearby visual companion, we achieve $<$0.15\% per-band sensitivity in relative brightness changes across the 0.9--2.4$\mu$m bandwidth. We find that 2MASS~J0835$-$0819 exhibits low-level ($\lesssim$ 0.4\% per band) variability with no spectral dependence, while 2MASS~J1821+1414 varies by up to $\pm$2\% at 1~$\mu$m and declines toward longer wavelengths. The latter result extends the variability trend observed in prior $HST$/WFC3 spectral monitoring of 2MASS~J1821+1414 over 1.1--1.6~$\mu$m. We reproduce the variability amplitude spectrum of 2MASS~J1821+1414 with Mie extinction of sub-micron dust particles, although this model becomes too strong at short wavelengths. An alternate model based on surface hot spots more accurately reproduces the variability amplitude spectrum, but requires implausibly large temperature variations. {\bf [phase variation? differences between 0835 and 1821?]}

\section{Introduction}

The atmospheres of L-type stars and brown dwarfs (1300~K $\lesssim$ {\teff} $\lesssim$ 2200~K; \citealt{2015ApJ...810..158F}) are sufficiently cool that species of mineral and metal condensates form spontaneously in their atmospheres \citep{1996A&A...305L...1T,2010ApJ...716.1060V}.
In addition to influencing spectral energy distributions (e.g., \citealt{2001ApJ...556..357A,2008ApJ...674..451B}) and photospheric chemistry (e.g., \citealt{2000ApJ...531..438B}), condensates can coalesce into large-scale cloud and haze structures \citep{1989ApJ...338..314L,2001ApJ...556..872A,2014Natur.505..654C}
whose surface and vertical structure may produce rotationally-modulated brightness variations (e.g., \citealt{2012ApJ...750..105R}), and long-term variations from differential rotation and/or cloud structure evolution (e.g., \citealt{2009ApJ...701.1534A,2013A&A...555L...5G,2016ApJ...826....8Y}). Evidence of cloud-driven variability extends to the cooler T dwarfs (e.g., \citealt{2009ApJ...701.1534A,2012ApJ...760L..31B,2015ApJ...799..154M}), and virtually all L dwarfs and most T dwarfs likely have photospheric heterogeneities leading to infrared flux variations $\gtrsim$0.2\% in amplitude \citep{2015ApJ...799..154M}. Clouds and hazes are important constituents of exoplanetary atmospheres as well (e.g., \citealt{2011ApJ...733...65B,2014Natur.505...69K,2016Natur.529...59S}).

Multi-wavelength monitoring of low-temperature stars and brown dwarfs allows the measurement of cloud vertical structure, as gray grain scattering opacity competes with strongly wavelength-dependent molecular gas opacity. The amplitude of variability as a function of wavelength samples the vertical depths of cloud layers \citep{2013ApJ...768..121A}, and amplitude spectra have been show to vary with effective temperature, ({\teff}; e.g., \citealt{2015ApJ...798L..13Y}) and surface gravity (e.g., \citealt{2016ApJ...829L..32L}). Wavelength-dependent phase variance in lightcurves has also been observed \citep{2012ApJ...760L..31B,2013ApJ...778L..10B,2016ApJ...826....8Y}. Since different wavelengths sample different photospheric depths in the highly structured spectra of L and T dwarfs, these phase variations have been interpreted as arising from the relative motion of distinct cloud layers or deep thermal pulsation \citep{2014ApJ...785..158R}. 

Broad-band variability amplitudes are typically $<$1\% in L and T dwarfs, with some dramatic exceptions \citep{2009ApJ...701.1534A,2012ApJ...750..105R,2013A&A...555L...5G,2016ApJ...829L..32L}. 
Some ground-based spectral (e.g., CLOUDS; \citealt{2008A&A...487..277G}) and broad-band photometric monitoring surveys (e.g., \citealt{1999A&A...348..800B,2003MNRAS.346..473K,2014ApJ...793...75R,2014A&A...566A.111W}) have been limited to $>$1-3\% relative precision due to telluric atmospheric instabilities (i.e., ``red noise'') and insufficient calibrators \citep{2003MNRAS.339..477B}.
In contrast, the stability of space-based platforms $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ ($HST$), $Spitzer$ and $Kepler$ provide order-of-magnitude improvements in relative photometric and spectro-photometric precision, and have been responsible for the discovery of the majority of known L and T dwarf variables \citep{2013ApJ...768..121A,2013ApJ...779..172G,2015ApJ...799..154M}. However, these facilities are not suited, for building up robust statistical samples to assess the physical bases of surface heterogeneity or different variability modes.

Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) which uses references stars to correct for telluric effects with a multi-object spectrograph or long slit \citep[e.g.][]{bean10,bean2013,gibson13clouds,stevenson2016hatp26} has significantly improved the precision of ground-based spectro-photometry. \citet{2014ApJ...783....5S} achieved $<$0.1\% per band variability precision for the planet-host star Corot-1 using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) SpeX spectrograph \citep{2003PASP..115..362R}, by simultaneously monitoring the star and a nearby visual binary companion in a wide (3$\arcsec$) slit. This was sufficient to infer the presence of a cloud/haze layer in Corot-1b via transmission spectroscopy. A similar investigation of the disintegrating rocky exoplanet KIC 12557548b  enabled the characterization of the grain properties of its tidal debris tail \citep{2016ApJ...826..156S}. In a parallel effort, \citet{2014ApJ...785...48B} obtained $<$0.5\% per-band relative precision across the 1--2.5~$\mu$m band with IRTF/SpeX for the variable T dwarf Luhman 16B, by simultaneously observing it and its L dwarf companion. These studies demonstrate that high-precision, near-infrared spectral monitoring observations can be achieved from the ground and with IRTF from 1-2.5~$\mu$m.

This article reports the results of a pilot study adapting these methods to measuring the variability of two L-type dwarfs with nearby visual companions. We describe the target identification strategy and pilot targets in Section~\ref{sec:targets}.
In Section~\ref{sec:obs}, we describe our monitoring observations and data reduction procedures to generate relative spectro-photometric time series.
In Section~\ref{sec:ModelFits}, we analyze these time series using sinusoidal model fits over discrete spectral bands to generate individual light curves and amplitude spectra.
We then fit the variability amplitude spectra to two different physical models, Mie scattering from clouds and heterogeneous temperature spots, to assess which more accurately reproduces the data.
We summarize our results in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{Target Selection}\label{sec:targets}

We identified potential targets for relative spectro-photometry by selecting among the $\approx$200 known L dwarfs\footnote{We identified these sources from DwarfArchives,  \url{http://dwarfarchives.org}. The declination range corresponds to the visibility region of IRTF.} with $H$ $<$ 14 and $-$30{\degree}  $<$ $\delta$ $<$ +67{\degree} those sources that have comparable-brightness ($\Delta{H}$ $<$ 1) visual binary companions at apparent separations of 5$\arcsec$--30$\arcsec$. We identified 30 potential targets, and prioritized those with previously detected photometric variability or rotational $v\sin{i}$ measurements indicating periods $\leq$10~hr.  Two sources were identified as ideal initial targets (Table~\ref{tab:bdProp}).
2MASS~J08354256$-$0819237 (hereafter {\sha}; \citealt{2003AJ....126.2421C} is a bright, nearby ($d$ = 8.5$\pm$0.8~pc; \citealt{2012ApJ...752...56F}) L5 dwarf that has been observed to vary in both optical and near-infrared bands with a period of 3.1~hr and an amplitude of $\sim$1\%  \citep{2004MNRAS.354..378K,2014A&A...566A.111W}. Its $v\sin{i}$ = 14.2$\pm$0.4~{\kms} \citep{2010ApJ...723..684B} suggests a near pole-on viewing angle assuming radius R = 1~{\rjup}. There is an $H$ = 12.3 star (2MASS~J08354383$-$0819212) at a separation of 19$\arcsec$ suitable for relative flux calibration (Figure~\ref{fig:images}). 
2MASS J18212815+1414010 (hereafter {\shb}; \citealt{2008ApJ...686..528L}) is a similarly bright and nearby ($d$ = 9.38$\pm$0.03; \citealt{2016MNRAS.455..357S}) L4.5 dwarf, which exhibits a peculiar near-infrared spectrum attributed to thick clouds \citep{2008ApJ...686..528L,2015ApJS..219...33G}. This source is a photometric variable with a period of 4.2$\pm$0.1~hr \citep{2015ApJ...799..154M} and $v\sin{i}$ = 28.85$\pm$0.16~{\kms}, suggesting a near equator-on orientation.  \citet{2015ApJ...798L..13Y} measured 1--3\% spectral variability with $HST$/WFC3 over 1.1--1.6~$\micron$, with greater variabilty at shorter wavelengths. There are two suitably bright comparison stars within 20$\arcsec$ for relative calibration: 2MASS~J18212812+1414089 with $H$ = 12.6 at 7$\arcsec$ separation and 2MASS~J18212715+1413482 with $H$ = 12.0 at 29$\arcsec$ separation; we chose the latter for our monitoring observations.

\section{Observations}\label{sec:obs}

We observed {\sha} and {\shb} for one night each with the IRTF/SpeX (Table \ref{tab:obsParam}).
{\sha} was observed for 4.65 hours, covering 1.5 rotation periods; {\shb} was observed for 7.47 hours, covering 1.8 rotation periods.
Following \citet{2014ApJ...783....5S}, we used SpeX in its prism-dispersed mode, obtaining 0.9--2.4~$\micron$ spectra in a single order at low dispersion. The short-wavelength limit was set by the use of a 0.9~$\mu$m dichroic which deflected optical light into the MIT Optical Rapid Imaging System (MORIS) camera \citep{2011PASP..123..461G}, which was used for $i$-band guiding.
For {\sha} our exposures were 15~sec, which was sufficient for guiding but not precision photometry. For {\shb}, we were able to guide on sources in the SpeX imaging channel, so we increased the $i$-band exposures to 60~sec to obtain a simultaneous $i$-band light-curve.

Wavelength calibrations were performed using observations of ThAr  emission lamps with the 0.3$\times$60$\arcsec$.
We also obtained calibration sequences of ThAr and flat-field lamps with the 3$\times$60$\arcsec$ slit  before and after the brown dwarf time series to obtain information on the flat field and any flexure in the instrument with telescope orientation.

[ADAM STOPPED HERE]

For 2MASS J0835, we use a combination of an incandescent lamp and a sky frame to construct a flat.
Due to flexure and motion with thin the system, we use a sky frame to get the structure of the background with low order polynomials fits in the horizontal direction.
All of the (large $\gtrsim$ 30 px) structure is removed from the lamp frame with low order polynomials, and this residual flat is used to correct the pixel-to-pixel variations while the sky frame is used to measure the larger structures.
We cross-correlate the sky frame with each image to account for any spatial shifts and apply the pixel-to-pixel flat to construct a custom flat field for every image.

For 2MASS J1821, we did not have sufficient sky frames for sky flats so we use an incandescent lamp for flat fielding.
Here, we fit the flat field structure with low order polynomials in the incandescent flat field to describe the spatial structure and use the residual image as a pixel-to-pixel flat.
As in 2MASS J0835, we cross-correlate the spatial structure image to find a shift and then multiply it by the pixel-to-pixel flat to create a custom flat field for every image.
In both 2MASS J0835 and 2MASS J1821 we remove all spectral structure from the flat fields to make ``response'' images that do not include the spectral structure of the lamp or dramatically alter the flux levels that would affect SNR calculations from the number of photo-electrons in a given pixel.

As in \citet{2016ApJ...826..156S}, we perform background subtraction over the entire slit with polynomial fit.
We use a 4th order polynomial through all points outside +/-30 pixels of each aperture for the background subtraction.
We use optimal extraction \citep{horne1986optimalE} to maximize the signal to noise.
The spatial profiles are fit with low order polynomials with 20$\sigma$ rejection to remove cosmic rays and bad pixels.
These spatial profiles are then used to calculate a weighted sum spectrum.

\end{figure*} 

Figure \ref{fig:specphot} shows the dynamic spectra of both targets, as well as the median spectra of the target and reference stars.
{\sha} shows no variations or systematics at the $\lesssim1$\% level, while {\shb} shows a clear periodic signal that is strongest at the shortest wavelengths and declines in amplitude toward the longest wavelengths. The periodic signal is coincident with the 4.2~hr period measured by \citet{2015ApJ...799..154M}, enabling confirmation that the signal is astrophysical rather than arising from systematic effects (see \citealt{2016ApJ...826..156S}).
{\shb} does exhibits some systematic features near the strong telluric absorption bands at 1.4 and 1.8~$\mu$m, likely caused by slight wavelength drifts and lower signals-to-noise.

\end{figure*} 


\section{Sinusoidal Model Fits}\label{sec:ModelFits}

We extracted separate light curves for each target in 25 spectral bins of width 0.060~$\mu$m, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tserPfold}. Each of these were fit to a simple sinusoidal model:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cosfit}
F(t) = A \cos(2 \pi (t - t_0)/\tau) + B t + C
\end{equation}
Here, $F(t)$ is the flux as a function of time $t$, $A$ is the amplitude of periodic variations, $t_0$ is the time of maximum periodic flux, $\tau$ is period of the variations, and $B$ and $C$ are linear terms describing any baseline trend.
For the fits, we let $A$, $t_0$, $B$ and $C$ be free parameters, but fixed $\tau$ at the literature value of rotation period due to systematic trends (with a period of $\sim$24 hr) caused by uncorrected telluric variations.
We also imposed a prior that $A \geq 0$ so that solutions with a $\pi$ phase offset and negative amplitude were ignored.

	\label{fig:ampSpec}
\end{figure*} 

Figure \ref{fig:ampSpec} shows the best fit amplitudes as a function of wavelength.
We use the standard deviation of points near minimum to estimate the noise in the flux time series.
The Levenberg-Marquardt chi-squared minimization code \texttt{mpfit} is used to fit each wavelength bin independently and propagate the errors in the flux time series to amplitude uncertainty.
The amplitude spectrum ($A$ as a function of wavelength) of 2MASS J0835, (Figure \ref{fig:ampspec0835}), shows small ($\lesssim 0.4\%$) amplitudes with a flat trend as a function of wavelength.
2MASS J1821, on the other hand, shows a clear decreasing trend as function of wavelength.
This is the same trend observed for 2MASS J1821 by HST over a shorter wavelength range (1.1 to 1.7~$\mu$m) by \citet{2015ApJ...798L..13Y}.
We shade the regions from 1.32 to 1.5~$\mu$m and 1.78 to 1.95~$\mu$m in Figure \ref{fig:ampSpec} because these wavelength ranges are affected by telluric water vapor absorption not fully removed by the simultaneous reference star.

\subsection{Mie Scattering Fit}

We model the wavelength dependence of 2MASS 1821 as an optically thin cloud layer consisting of a log-normal distribution of particle sizes.
In this simple model, the amplitude of the variability is directly proportional to the opacity or $Q_{ext}$ of the particles.
We model the extinction coefficient, $Q_{ext}$ from the \texttt{IDL} Mie theory code \texttt{mie\_single.pro} \citep{grainger04} to calculate the extinction as a function of wavelength.
We use the complex indices of refraction from \citet{dorschner95pyrox} for Mg-rich pyroxene grains (MgSiO$_3$).
For the particle size distribution we assume a log-normal distribution around a characteristic size, $s$ and a standard deviation of the logarithm (scale parameter), $\sigma$ =0.5.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ampspec1821mie} shows the simple Mie scattering model as compared to the data for two example particle sizes of 0.1~$\mu$m and 0.2~$\mu$m.
In these cases the reduced chi-squared values are 9.6 and 2.5 respectively, when ignoring the points within the shaded telluric contamination regions.

\citet{2015ApJ...798L..13Y} also observe wavelength-dependent variability of 2MASS J1821 with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) Wide Field Camera (WFC3) over 2 visits of 3 orbits each.
Their maximum over minimum flux spectrum is converted to an amplitude spectrum by assuming that the amplitude is half the difference in maximum and minimum flux, which can be shown to be 
\begin{equation}
A  = \frac{f_R - 1}{f_R + 1}
\end{equation}\label{eq:ampFromRatio}
where $f_R$ is the flux ratio of the maximum over minimum flux.

The WFC3 amplitude spectrum is shown with the data in Figure \ref{fig:ampspec1821mie}.
There is a multiplicative offset between the IRTF and WFC3 spectrum because they were taken at different epochs and therefore different spatial cloud and temperature distributions.
The WFC3 spectrum is not affected by the telluric absorption the way the SpeX data is.
\citet{2015ApJ...798L..13Y} find that the WFC3 spectrum has no significant water vapor absorption which indicates a high haze layer in 2MASS J1821 and consistent with our Mie scattering fit.

A similar amplitude versus wavelength trend was recently observed for WISEP J004701.06+680352.1 \citep{2016ApJ...829L..32L}, which has very red ($J-K$ = 2.55) spectral energy distribution thought to be caused by a high altitude haze layer.
In WISEP J0047, the wavelength trend could be fit by $\sim 0.4~\mu$m forsterite grains, similar to our characteristic particle size.

\subsection{Spot Model Fit}\label{sec:spotModel}

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{temperature_drawing.pdf}
\caption{A simple two region model with two different temperatures and different areal fractions for longitudes 0\degree\ and 180\degree.}\label{fig:tdiffschem}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

Another simple model we attempt is a spot model - that the brown dwarf spectral variability has to do with a non-uniform temperature distribution on the brown dwarf in the same way that starspots modulate the brightness of hydrogen burning stars as they spin.
In Figure \ref{fig:ampspec1821tdiff}, we fit the same amplitude spectrum as in Figure \ref{fig:ampspec1821mie}.
This time we model the data with two temperature regions as shown in Figure \ref{fig:tdiffschem} with two opposite longitudes of the planet at the brightness minimum and maximum.
We assume that are each in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) so that the flux is proportional to the Planck function times the areal coverage.
The flux ratio between maximum and minimum flux is then
\begin{equation}
f_{R,\lambda} = \frac{\alpha_1 B_\lambda(T_1) + (1-\alpha_1) B_\lambda(T_2)}{\alpha_2 B_\lambda(T_1) + (1-\alpha_2) B_\lambda(T_2)}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are the areal fractions of the first ($T_1$ and second ($T_2$) regions respectively, $B_\lambda$ is the Planck function, and $T_1$ and $T_2$ are the temperatures of the two levels.
$\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are limited to [0,1].
Using equation \ref{eq:ampFromRatio}, the amplitude then becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:twoTempAmpAlphas}
A_\lambda = \frac{\left(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 \right) \left(B_\lambda(T_1) - B_\lambda(T_2) \right)}{\left(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2\right) B_\lambda(T_1) + \left(2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2\right) B_\lambda(T_2)}.
\end{equation}
If the temperature difference is significant so that one Planck function is in the Wien's limit while the other is in the Rayleigh Jeans tail, the cooler temperature essentially becomes black and the contrast approaches a constant for short wavelengths.
If we ignore projection effects for small area coverage, the effective temperature is 
\begin{equation}
\sigma T_{eff}^4 \approx (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) \sigma T_1^4 + (2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) \sigma T_2^4
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the Stephan-Boltzmann constant.

In the model fitting, we found a strong correlation between $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$.
There-fore we re-parameterized with $\beta = \alpha_1 - \alpha_2$, so that $\alpha_2 = \alpha_1 - \beta$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:twoTempAmp}
A_\lambda = \frac{\beta \left(B_\lambda(T_1) - B_\lambda(T_2) \right)}{\left(2 \alpha_1 - \beta \right) B_\lambda(T_1) + \left(2 - 2 \alpha_1 + \beta \right) B_\lambda(T_2)}.
\end{equation}

We start by considering a two-faced model where $\alpha_1$ = 1 and $\alpha_2$ = 0, so that the two halves of the brown dwarf are different temperatures.
To be close to the effective temperature of the brown dwarf, we fix $T_1$ to be 1600 K and only vary $T_2$.
This model is a poor match to the data, also shown in Figure \ref{fig:ampspec1821tdiff} with a reduced chi-squared, $\bar{\chi}^2$ = 15.
Next, we attempt a model where we allow $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ to be free parameters and restrict the temperature limits of the two regions to [1300,2500] to ensure that the final effective temperature is close to the measured 1600 K \citep{gagne2015banyan7}.
The best fit model has $T_{eff} \approx $1590 K and $\bar{\chi}^2$=2.1, but pushes to the edges of our prior with $T_1$ = 2500 K and $T_2$ = 1300 K.
Finally, we consider a model where all four parameters, $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $T_1$ and $T_2$ are all free.
With these loose constraints, the model fits the data with $\bar{\chi}^2$ = 1.3, consistent with the data, but not with the effective temperature ($T_{eff}$ = 850 K).
The $\alpha$ values,  $\alpha_i <<$ 1 indicating that the model fits with dark patches on a small fraction of the surface.

The temperature contrasts in these models (with the exception of the two-faced model which poorly matches the data) are significantly larger than the expected 50 K horizontal temperature variations expected in circulation models \citep{showman2013bdgpDynamics}.
Therefore, we suspect that hot or cold spots on the surface are a less plausible explanation of the variability of 2MASS J1821 than a heterogenous temperature distribution.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We observed two brown dwarfs of spectral type L4-L5: 2MASS 1821 and 2MASS 0835.
These brown dwarfs have temperatures near the condensation temperatures of MgSiO$_3$ and Mg$_2$SiO$_4$.
We obtained high precision ground-based spectrophotometry of both systems to measure the variability spectra of these systems with the IRTF.
After fitting sinusoids to both of the time series, we find that 2MASS 0835 has low levels of variability and no significant wavelength dependence.

2MASS J1821 shows significant variability up to the 1.1\% amplitude at short wavelengths (0.8$\mu$m) which decreases towards the near infrared (2.4$\mu$m).
This is consistent with HST measurements for the system that show a gradual decrease in variability amplitude with wavelength \citep{2016ApJ...826....8Y} from 1.1$\mu$m to 1.7 $\mu$m with no decrease in the water vapor band.
The lack of the water vapor band gives evidence of a high altitude aerosol layer in the atmosphere.

We fit the variability amplitude spectrum with an optically thin Mie scattering model and find it is consistent with Mg-rich pyroxene grains with sub-micron sized particles.
A log-normal particle size distribution with a median of 0.2$\mu$m fits the data with a $\bar{\chi^2}$ of 2.5.
We also model the wavelength dependence with a spotted surface model with two different Planck functions covering different spatial regions.
The two temperature region model can fit variability amplitude spectrum well within errors, but gives implausible temperature differences.
Therefore, we favor the Mie scattering model as a better explanation for the variability amplitude spectrum.

\section{Color-Magnitude Diagram}

Figure \ref{fig:CMD} shows the color magnitude diagram from the sample of brown dwarfs in \citet{dupuy2012ltparallax}, which includes 2MASS J0835 but not 2MASS J1821.
We highlight these two brown dwarfs to be contrasted with the rest of the population.

\section{Example Posterior Distributions}

\subsection{Time Series}
In Figure \ref{fig:postCosfit}, we show the posterior distributions of a sinusoidal model (Equation \ref{eq:cosfit}) fit to the data using \texttt{emcee} \citep{foreman-mackey2013emcee} for an example wavelength bin of 1.08~$\mu$m.
This wavelength bin is one of the high amplitude fits that is relatively unaffected by telluric contamination.
In this example, we input photon noise only.
We impose priors on the amplitude $A_1 > 0$, $|t_t| < 6 hr$ (to avoid multiple periodic solutions) and that the period $0 < \tau < 6 hr$ so that the periodicity is shorter than the observation window length.
The model parameters are close to Gaussian and the only visible correlation is between the time offset, $t_1$, and the rotation period $\tau$.
The maximum likelihood solution is shown in Figure \ref{fig:model2Cosfit} and has a chi-squared per degree of freedom ($\bar{\chi^2}$) of 12.1

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{corner_example.pdf}
\caption{Example posterior distributions for an MCMC fit to the time series using Equation \ref{eq:cosfit} for the wavelength bin 1.08~$\mu$m.
Amplitude, $A_1$ is in percent, the time offset $t_1$ is in hours, the period of oscillation, $\tau$, is in units of hours, B is in units of percent per hour and C is the offset constant in fraction (not percent).
We only input photon counting and read noise statistics for the errors.
This is likely and underestimate for the uncertainty in the time series.
}\label{fig:postCosfit}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

Since Equation \ref{eq:cosfit} is a poor fit to the data, as visible in Figure \ref{fig:model2Cosfit}, we also fit a two term cosine model.
In the two term model, we add a second cosine function at twice the frequency:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cosfit2term}
F(t) = A_1 \cos(2 \pi (t - t_1)/\tau) + A_2 \cos(4 \pi (t - t_2)/\tau) +  B t + C.
\end{equation}
Now there are two amplitude parameters $A_1$ and $A_2$ and two time offset parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$.
Figure \ref{fig:model2Cosfit} shows the best fit compared to the data for this 2 term sinusoidal fit.
We assume the same priors as the 1 term sinusoidal fit with both $A_1$ and $A_2 > 0$.
The two term model appears visually to fit the data well.
The $\bar{\chi^2}$ is still 7.9, so it is not the expected 1.0.
However, the error bars are underestimated when only including photon and read noise components.
With exoplanet light curves, the standard deviation of the out-of-transit baseline flux can be used as an estimate for errors. With the brown dwarf rotation light curves, there is not flat baseline over which to measure error levels.
