\begin{abstract}
Low-temperature L dwarfs exhibit low-level, rotationally-modulated photometric variability generally associated with heterogeneous, cloud-covered atmospheres. The spectral character of these variations yield insight into the particle sizes and vertical structure of the clouds. Here we present the results of a high precision, ground-based, near-infrared, spectral monitoring study of two mid-type L dwarfs, 2MASS~J08354256$-$0819237 and 2MASS~J18212815+1414010, using the SpeX instrument on the Infrared Telescope Facility. By simultaneously observing a nearby visual companion, we achieve $<$0.15\% per-band sensitivity in relative brightness changes across the 0.9--2.4$\mu$m bandwidth. We find that 2MASS~J0835$-$0819 exhibits marginal ($\lesssim$ 0.5\% per band) variability with no spectral dependence while 2MASS~J1821+1414 varies by up to $\pm$1.3\% at 0.9~$\mu$m, with the variability amplitude declining toward longer wavelengths.  We detect no statistically significant variation across the wavelengths for the phase of maximum flux variation. The latter result extends the variability trend observed in prior $HST$/WFC3 spectral monitoring of 2MASS~J1821+1414, and we show that the full 1--2.5~$\mu$m variability amplitude spectrum can be reproduced by Mie extinction of 0.24 $\mu$m dust particles. The different variability behaviors of 2MASS~J0835$-$0819 and  2MASS~J1821+1414 suggests dependencies on viewing angle and/or overall cloud content, underlying factors that can be examined through a broader variability survey.

\section{Introduction}

The atmospheres of L-type stars and brown dwarfs (1300~K $\lesssim$ {\teff} $\lesssim$ 2200~K; \citealt{2015ApJ...810..158F}) are sufficiently cool that species of mineral and metal condensates form spontaneously in their atmospheres \citep{1996A&A...305L...1T,2010ApJ...716.1060V}.
In addition to influencing spectral energy distributions (e.g., \citealt{2001ApJ...556..357A,2008ApJ...674..451B}) and photospheric chemistry (e.g., \citealt{2000ApJ...531..438B}), condensates can coalesce into large-scale cloud and haze structures \citep{1989ApJ...338..314L,2001ApJ...556..872A,2014Natur.505..654C}
whose surface and vertical structure may produce rotationally-modulated brightness variations (e.g., \citealt{2012ApJ...750..105R}), and long-term variations from differential rotation and/or cloud structure evolution (e.g., \citealt{2009ApJ...701.1534A,2013A&A...555L...5G,2016ApJ...826....8Y}). Evidence of cloud-driven variability extends to the cooler T dwarfs (e.g., \citealt{2009ApJ...701.1534A,2012ApJ...760L..31B,2015ApJ...799..154M}), and virtually all L dwarfs and most T dwarfs likely have cloud deck heterogeneities leading to infrared flux variations $\gtrsim$0.2\% in amplitude \citep{2015ApJ...799..154M}. Clouds and hazes are important constituents of exoplanetary atmospheres as well (e.g., \citealt{2011ApJ...733...65B,2014Natur.505...69K,2016Natur.529...59S}).

Multi-wavelength monitoring of low-temperature stars and brown dwarfs allows the measurement of cloud vertical structure and composition, as gray grain scattering opacity competes with strongly wavelength-dependent molecular gas opacity. The amplitude of variability as a function of wavelength samples the vertical depths of cloud layers \citep{2013ApJ...768..121A}, and amplitude spectra have been shown to vary with effective temperature, ({\teff}; e.g., \citealt{2015ApJ...798L..13Y}) and surface gravity (e.g., \citealt{2016ApJ...829L..32L}).
Wavelength-dependent phase variance in lightcurves has also been observed \citep{2012ApJ...760L..31B,2013ApJ...778L..10B,2016ApJ...826....8Y}.
Since different wavelengths sample different photospheric depths in the highly structured spectra of L and T dwarfs, these phase variations have been interpreted as arising from the relative motion of distinct cloud layers or deep thermal pulsation \citep{2014ApJ...785..158R}. 

Broad-band variability amplitudes are typically $<$1\% in L and T dwarfs, with some dramatic exceptions \citep{2009ApJ...701.1534A,2012ApJ...750..105R,2013A&A...555L...5G,2016ApJ...829L..32L}. 
Ground-based spectral (e.g., CLOUDS; \citealt{2008A&A...487..277G}) and broad-band photometric monitoring surveys (e.g., \citealt{1999A&A...348..800B,2003MNRAS.346..473K,2014ApJ...793...75R,2014A&A...566A.111W}) are generally limited to $>$1-3\% relative precision due to telluric atmospheric instabilities (i.e., ``red noise'') and insufficient calibrators \citep{2003MNRAS.339..477B}.
In contrast, the stability of space-based platforms such as $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ ($HST$), $Spitzer$ and $Kepler$ provide order-of-magnitude improvements in relative photometric and spectro-photometric precision, and have been responsible for the discovery of the majority of known L and T dwarf variables \citep{2013ApJ...768..121A,2013ApJ...779..172G,2015ApJ...799..154M}. However, these facilities are poorly suited for building up robust statistical samples to assess the physical origins of surface heterogeneity, or evolution in variability modes. 

Ground-based Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) with a multi-object or long slit spectrograph, in which references stars are simultaneously observed to correct for telluric effects  (e.g., \citealt{bean10,bean2013,gibson13clouds,stevenson2016hatp26}) can significantly improve the precision of ground-based spectro-photometry. \citet{2014ApJ...783....5S} achieved $<$0.1\% per band variability precision for the planet-host star Corot-1 using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) SpeX spectrograph \citep{2003PASP..115..362R}, by simultaneously monitoring the star and a nearby visual binary companion in a wide (3$\arcsec$) slit. This was sufficient to infer the presence of a cloud/haze layer in Corot-1b via transmission spectroscopy. A similar investigation of the disintegrating rocky exoplanet KIC 12557548b  enabled the characterization of the grain properties of its tidal debris tail \citep{2016ApJ...826..156S}. In a parallel effort, \citet{2014ApJ...785...48B} obtained $<$0.5\% per-band relative precision across the 1--2.5~$\mu$m band with IRTF/SpeX for the variable T dwarf Luhman 16B, by simultaneously observing it and its L dwarf companion. These studies demonstrate that high-precision, near-infrared spectral monitoring observations can be achieved from the ground.

This article reports the results of a pilot study adapting these methods to measuring the variability of two L-type dwarfs with nearby visual companions. We describe our target selection process and pilot target properties in Section~\ref{sec:targets}.
In Section~\ref{sec:obs}, we describe our monitoring observations and data reduction procedures to generate relative spectro-photometric time series.
In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, we analyze these time series using sinusoidal model fits over discrete spectral bands to generate individual light curves and amplitude spectra.
We then fit the variability amplitude spectra to two different physical models, Mie scattering from clouds and heterogeneous temperature spots, to assess which more accurately reproduces the data.
We summarize our results in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{Target Selection and Characterization}\label{sec:targets}

We identified potential targets for relative spectro-photometry by selecting among the $\approx$200 known L dwarfs\footnote{We identified these sources from DwarfArchives,  \url{http://dwarfarchives.org}. The declination range corresponds to the visibility region of IRTF.} with $H$ $<$ 14 and $-$30{\degree}  $<$ $\delta$ $<$ +67{\degree} those sources that have comparable-brightness ($\Delta{H}$ $<$ 1) visual binary companions at apparent separations of 5$\arcsec$--30$\arcsec$. We identified 30 potential targets, and prioritized those with previously detected photometric variability or rotational $v\sin{i}$ measurements indicating periods $\leq$10~hr.  Two sources were identified as ideal initial targets (Table~\ref{tab:bdProp}).

2MASS~J08354256$-$0819237 (hereafter {\sha}; \citealt{2003AJ....126.2421C} is a bright, nearby ($d$ = 8.5$\pm$0.8~pc; \citealt{2012ApJ...752...56F}) L5 dwarf that shows signatures of low surface gravity \citep{2016ApJ...833...96L}. 
This source has been reported to vary in both optical and near-infrared bands with a period of 3.1~hr and an amplitude of $\sim$1\%  \citep{2004MNRAS.354..378K,2014A&A...566A.111W}.
Its $v\sin{i}$ = 14.2$\pm$0.4~{\kms} \citep{2010ApJ...723..684B} suggests a near pole-on viewing angle assuming a radius R = 1~{\rjup}.
There is an $H$ = 12.3 source (2MASS~J08354383$-$0819212) at a separation of 19$\arcsec$ suitable for relative flux calibration (Figure~\ref{fig:images}). 
2MASS J18212815+1414010 (hereafter {\shb}; \citealt{2008ApJ...686..528L}) is a similarly bright and nearby ($d$ = 9.38$\pm$0.03; \citealt{2016MNRAS.455..357S}) L4.5 dwarf, which exhibits a peculiar near-infrared spectrum attributed to youth and/or thick clouds \citep{2008ApJ...686..528L,2015ApJS..219...33G,2016ApJ...833...96L}.
This source is a photometric variable with a period of 4.2$\pm$0.1~hr \citep{2015ApJ...799..154M} and $v\sin{i}$ = 28.85$\pm$0.16~{\kms}, suggesting a near equator-on orientation.  \citet{2015ApJ...798L..13Y} measured 1--3\% spectral variability with $HST$/WFC3 over 1.1--1.6~$\micron$, with greater variabilty at shorter wavelengths.
There are two suitably bright comparison stars within 20$\arcsec$ for relative calibration: 2MASS~J18212812+1414089 with $H$ = 12.6 at 7$\arcsec$ separation and 2MASS~J18212715+1413482 with $H$ = 12.0 at 29$\arcsec$ separation; we chose the latter for our monitoring observations.



To characterize the atmospheric regions probed by our observations, we analyzed previously 
obtained IRTF/SpeX data for these sources \citep{2008ApJ...686..528L,2010ApJ...710.1142B}.
Direct comparison to spectral standards following the convention of \citet{2010ApJS..190..100K} indicate near-infrared
classifications of L7 for {\sha} and L5 for {\shb} (Figure~\ref{fig:tbright}). The former is considerably later than the L5 optical classification previously reported by \citet{2003AJ....126.2421C}. We confirm the intermediate low surface gravity classification (INT-G) reported by \citet{2016ApJ...833...96L} based on the indices of \citet{2013ApJ...772...79A} using an L7 classification. The discrepancy between the optical and near-infrared classifications of this source is likely related to surface gravity effects. {\shb}, on the other hand, is a good match to the L5 spectral standard and has a field dwarf gravity classification.

We computed brightness temperature spectra from these data as
\begin{equation}
T_{\lambda,surf} = \frac{hc}{k\lambda}\left[\ln\left(1+\frac{2\pi{hc^2}}{I_{\lambda,surf}\lambda^5}\right)\right]^{-1}
\end{equation}
where the surface flux density $I_{\lambda,surf}$ is computed as
\begin{equation}
I_{\lambda,surf} = {\pi}B_{\lambda} = I_{\lambda,obs}\left(\frac{d}{R}\right)^2 = I_{\lambda,abs}\left(\frac{10~{\rm pc}}{R}\right)^2
\end{equation}
$I_{\lambda,obs}$ and $I_{\lambda,abs}$ are the observed and absolute flux densities, $d$ the source distance and $R$ the source radius.  Both spectra were normalized to absolute flux densities using their 2MASS $H$ magnitudes and measured parallaxes \citep{2016MNRAS.455..357S,2016AJ....152...24W}. We adopted radii from the evolutionary models of \citet{2003A&A...402..701B} assuming effective temperatures ({\teff}s) from \citet{2015ApJ...810..158F} based on these sources' bolometric luminosity measurements (Table~\ref{tab:bdProp}). Uncertainties in the spectral fluxes, absolute photometric calibration, adopted {\teff} and radius were propagated by Monte Carlo simulation.  For {\sha} we considered two cases: radii corresponding to an age of 50--200~Myr, the age range estimated for INT-G sources by \citet{2013ApJ...772...79A}, for which the evolutionary models predict radii of 0.147~R$_{\odot}$ to 0.115~R$_{\odot}$; and an age range of 1--5~Gyr for which the evolutionary models predict radii of 0.092~R$_{\odot}$ to 0.084~R$_{\odot}$.
For {\shb}, we assumed a lower age limit of 200~Myr based on its FLD-G classification, and an upper limit of 700~Myr based on the analysis of \citet{2016MNRAS.455..357S} range of 1--5~Gyr; evolutionary models predict radii of 0.120~R$_{\odot}$ to 0.097~R$_{\odot}$ for these ages.  

Figure~\ref{fig:tbright} shows the resulting brightness temperature spectra and their uncertainties from these calculations.  The spectral peaks for {\sha} are roughly constant at {\teff} = 1900$\pm$50~K in the field surface gravity case, and declines from 1700$\pm$20~K at the $J$-band peak to 1570$\pm$60~K at the $K$-band peak in the low surface gravity case.
{\bf [Adam, Are these Numbers still true? Also, should it be T$_b$ instead of T$_{eff}$?]}
Spectra models (e.g., \citealt{2012RSPTA.370.2765A}) predict brightness temperatures closer to the effective temperature at the $JHK$ flux peaks, so these data suggest {\sha} has an intermediate age/radius compared the assumptions made here. For {\shb}, 
brightness temperatures range from 1880$\pm$30~K at the $J$-band peak to 1700$\pm$40~K at the $K$-band peak.
These values are notably warmer than the {\teff} = 1614$\pm$100~K estimated from \citet{2015ApJ...810..158F} {\teff}/spectral type relation, but relatively consistent this source's earlier spectral type as compared to {\sha}. We conjecture that the Filippazzo et al.\ relation underestimates the {\teff} of this source due to its unusually dusty spectral energy distribution.

\section{Observations}\label{sec:obs}

We observed {\sha} and {\shb} for one night each with the IRTF/SpeX (Table \ref{tab:obsParam}).
{\sha} was observed for 4.65 hours, covering 1.5 rotation periods; {\shb} was observed for 7.47 hours, covering 1.8 rotation periods.
Following \citet{2014ApJ...783....5S}, we used SpeX in its prism-dispersed mode, obtaining 0.9--2.4~$\micron$ spectra in a single order at low dispersion. 
Both target and reference star were observed simultaneously by orienting the 3$\arcsec$$\times$60$\arcsec$ slit to align with the visual binary axis. This orientation is generally misaligned with the parallactic angle, but the good seeing (0$\farcs$5 at $H$-band) and wide slit minimizes differental color refraction. The effective resolution of the spectral data, set by seeing and pointing errors, are $\lambda$/$\Delta\lambda$ $\approx$ 50. Integration times were 60~s and 45~s for {\sha} and {\shb}, respectively. The short-wavelength limit of our spectral coverage was set by the use of a 0.9~$\mu$m dichroic which deflected optical light into the MIT Optical Rapid Imaging System (MORIS) camera \citep{2011PASP..123..461G}, which was used for $i$-band guiding.



%For {\sha} our MORIS exposures were 15~sec, which was sufficient for guiding but not precision photometry. For {\shb}, we were able to guide on sources in the SpeX imaging channel, so we increased the $i$-band exposures to 60~sec to obtain a simultaneous $i$-band light-curve.

The images were rectified by shifting each row to match a center row in between the two sources.
This was achieved by cross correlating the reference row with all other detector rows (which have the same background spectrum) and fitting a smooth function over the sources as in \citealt{2016ApJ...826..156S}.
We also obtained calibration sequences of ThAr and flat-field incadescent lamps with the 3$\arcsec$$\times$60$\arcsec$ slit  before and after the brown dwarf time series.
An additional set of ThAr emission lamp spectra were taken at the beginning and end of the observations (preceding and following the 3$\arcsec \times 60 \arcsec$ lamp spectra) with a 0.3$\arcsec\times60\arcsec$ slit for wavelength calibration.

For {\sha}, we used a combination of the flat-field lamp and a sky frame to construct a pixel response map, removing large-scale ($\gtrsim$ 30 pixels) structure with low order polynomial fits along spatial and spectral axes, and normalizing to the median response. 
To correct for instrument flexure, we also cross-correlated the sky frame with each science image to measure linear spatial shifts, which were $\pm$5~pixels or 0.5\arcsec\ for \sha\ and $\pm$1.5~pixels or 0.15\arcsec\ for \shb.
These shifts were used to apply a custom flat field for every image.
For {\shb}, we did not have sufficient sky frames so we used our incandescent lamp image for both flat fielding and flexure analysis.

As described in \citet{2016ApJ...826..156S}, we performed spatial background subtraction over the entire slit using a 4th-order polynomial fit to points more than 30 pixels away from the center of the source dispersion traces.  Spectra were optimally extracted \citep{1986ApJ...302..757H}, with spatial profiles fit to low order polynomials along the spectral direction one row at a time with 20$\sigma$ rejection to remove cosmic rays and bad pixels.
These spatial profiles were then used to calculate a weighted sum spectrum across the illuminated detector for each source and exposure. 
Typical signals-to-noise of the extracted spectra were 40 - 100 per spectral pixel (unbinned).
Relative spectra (source/reference) were then computed for each exposure.
Our image rectification process described above ensures that the wavelength solution is the same for each row if the image.
However, there are small additional shifts of the sources within the slit so another shift is performed between the sources to ensure the telluric features removed when dividing the two spectra.

%For MORIS reduction, we used the raw files and performed aperture photometry with the IDL \texttt{aper} procedure using an aperture size of 6 pixels and a sky annulus of 8-11 pixels.

\section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

\subsection{Light Curves}

Figure \ref{fig:specphot} shows the raw spectra of the two brown dwarfs, their reference spectra and the background spectra.
Neither the reference spectra nor the brown dwarfs spectra have any corrections applied for telluric absorption or instrumental spectral response.
The reference stars have significantly bluer spectra than the brown dwarfs, but nonetheless contain the same telluric absorption signatures.
The regions near 1.37~$\mu$m and 1.83~$\mu$m have significantly lower flux due to telluric water vapor absorption.

Figure \ref{fig:specphot} also shows the dynamic spectra (relative source brightness as a function of wavelength and time.
{\sha} has a dynamic spectra resembling white noise with no significant variations in either the spectral or spatial direction at the $\lesssim$0.5\% level.
{\shb}, on the other hand, shows a clear periodic signal that is strongest at the shortest wavelengths and declines in amplitude toward the longest wavelengths. The periodic signal is nearly coincident with the 4.2~hr period measured by \citet{2015ApJ...799..154M}, enabling confirmation that the signal is astrophysical rather than systematic (see \citealt{2016ApJ...826..156S}).
Both sources exhibit some systematic features in the strong telluric absorption bands at 1.4 and 1.8~$\mu$m, likely caused by residual wavelength drifts from flexure and lower signals-to-noise.

Individual narrow-band light curves are extracted for each target in 25 spectral bins of width 0.060~$\mu$m; these are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tserDetrend}.
The baseline trends (which scale linearly with time and linearly with airmass) have been removed from Figure~\ref{fig:tserDetrend}, but the original light curves can be viewed in Figure \ref{fig:tserNoDetrend}.
The uncertainties in these curves due to photon and read noise range from 0.2\% to 0.6\% per exposure.
We measure the standard deviations of the time series for wavelength regions that have no significant variations near the rotation period of the brown dwarfs and compare it to the expected photon and read noise.
In these wavelength bins, the standard deviations of the points is about 4$\times$ the expected read noise and photon noise.
We attribute this to correlated errors between wavelengths and as a simple approximation multiply all error bars by a factor of 4 to account for these systematics.

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:tserDetrend}, we see minimal variation in the lightcurves of {\sha}, but pronounced variation in {\shb}, particular in bands $<$1.8~$\mu$m. 
These variations are periodic with ``double-hump'' structures at peak amplitudes around -2.7~hr and +1.3~hr.
The amplitude of these variations is strongly wavelength-dependent with $\sim$3.0\% peak-to-trough variations at short wavelengths and near-zero amplitude at the longest wavelengths.

Each of the light curves were fit to a double sinusoidal model:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cosfit}
\begin{split}
F(t) = \left( A_1 \cos(2 \pi (t - t_1)/\tau) + A_2 \cos(4 \pi (t - t_2)/\tau) + 1\right) \\
\times (B t + C + D a(t))
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $F(t)$ is the flux as a function of time $t$, $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the amplitudes of the two terms, $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the time of maximum periodic flux for each cosine term, $\tau$ is period of the variations, $a(t)$ is the airmass as a function of time and $B$, $C$ and $D$ are terms describing the baseline trend.
Since some wavelengths are affected by telluric contamination and we wish to avoid fitting harmonics, we impose a prior on the rotational period $\tau$.
For \sha\ we use a prior 2.6 $< \tau < $3.6 hr and for \shb\ we use 3.7 $< \tau <$ 4.7 hr.
Each of these ranges are $\pm$0.5 hr from the literature values \citep[3.1,4.2][]{2004MNRAS.354..378K,2015ApJ...799..154M}.
These priors are wide enough they don't drive the constraints on $\tau$ at short wavelengths for \shb\ but narrow enough to ensure that the sinusoidal fits do not fit the airmass trends with time.
Secondly, we restrict the time of maximum periodic flux such that $-\tau/2 < t_1 < \tau/2$ and $-\tau/4 < t_2 < \tau/4$ to make sure there are no 2$\pi$ degeneracies in the fit.


Figure \ref{fig:ampSpec} shows the MCMC posterior constraints for periodic amplitudes as a function of wavelength.
For {\sha} (Figure \ref{fig:ampspec0835}) we find small ($\lesssim 0.5\%$) amplitudes with a flat trend as a function of wavelength.
There is possible low level variability for the wavelengths long than 2.1$\mu$m.
\shb, on the other hand, shows a clear decreasing trend as function of wavelength.
In neither case, is there any statistically significant wavelength dependence to the time of maximum variation $t_1$.



The same trend of decreasing variability amplitude for \shb\ was observed by HST's WFC3 grism over a shorter wavelength range (1.1 to 1.7~$\mu$m) by \citet{2015ApJ...798L..13Y}, also shown in Figure \ref{fig:ampspec1821}.
The HST WFC3 maximum over minimum flux spectrum is converted to an amplitude spectrum by assuming that the amplitude is half the difference in maximum and minimum flux, which can be shown to be 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ampFromRatio}
A  = \frac{f_R - 1}{f_R + 1}
\end{equation}
where $f_R$ is the flux ratio of the maximum over minimum flux.
There is a multiplicative offset between the IRTF and WFC3 spectrum because they were taken at different epochs and therefore different spatial cloud and temperature distributions.
\citet{2015ApJ...798L..13Y} find that the WFC3 spectrum has no significant water vapor absorption which indicates a high haze layer in 2MASS J1821 and is consistent with our gradually decreasing slope from 1.1 to 1.7~$\mu$m.

\subsection{Mie Scattering Fit}

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{corner_j1821_mie_sc.pdf}
\caption{Posterior distributions to the simple Mie scattering fit to the amplitude spectrum for \shb\ assuming a forsterite composition.
The model includes an amplitude offset, $B$, (to account for areal coverage), a median particle radius, $r$ and a scale parameter $\sigma$.
The upper right inset plot shows the log-normal particle size distribution in blue for samples drawn from the MCMC results.
The red curve is the maximum likelihood log-normal particle size distribution.}\label{fig:corner1821mie}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

We model the wavelength dependence of \sha\ and \shb\ with a simple cloud model: an optically thin cloud layer consisting of a log-normal distribution of particle sizes.
If we assume the cloud is confined to one hemisphere of the brown dwarf, the amplitude of the variability ($A$) is directly proportional to the opacity of the particles.
We model the single particle extinction coefficient, $Q_{ext}$ from the \texttt{Python} Mie theory code \texttt{miescatter} \citep{bohren1983mie} to calculate the opacity as a function of wavelength.
We assume that the particles are spherical forsterite grains (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$).
We use a constant n=1.67 - 0.006 $j$ index of refraction because the real and imaginary parts of the index of refraction are relatively constant across the optical and near infrared \citep{scott1996forsterite}.

For the particle size distribution we assume a log-normal distribution around a characteristic size, $s$ and a standard deviation of the logarithm (scale parameter), $\sigma$ =0.5.
The spectral dependence is therefore modeled as 
\begin{equation}
A_1 = B \bar{Q_{avg}}(r)
\end{equation}
where $A_1$ is the amplitude, $B$ is a constant encapsulating the area and column density and $\bar{Q_{avg}}(r)$ is the average extinction coefficient averaged over all particles in the log-normal distribution with a median radius of $r$.
When fitting the amplitude spectra to our Mie model, we impose a prior on the median particle size radius ($0 \mu m < r < 5 \mu m$).
Beyond 5~$\mu$m the models are essentially unchanged with median particle radius.

For \sha\ we find that since no significant variability is detected that the particle size is unconstrained over the prior of $0~\mu m < r < 5~\mu m$.
We show the maximum likelihood model which has a near-zero amplitude.
For \shb\ we find that the amplitude spectrum is well fit by a Mie scattering model and the median particle radius is better constrained.
Figure \ref{fig:ampspec1821} shows the best-fit model which has a median particle radius of 0.28~$\mu$m grains.
This model has a reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.08 and is consistent with the measured amplitude spectrum.
Figure \ref{fig:corner1821mie} shows the posterior distribution for the $B$, $r$ and $\sigma$ parameters.
The derived median particle radius is $r$=0.24 $^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$~$\mu$m for our assumptions of optically thin clouds and a log-normal particle size distribution.
Considering the large number of possible grain geometries and compositions, this is an underestimate for the true uncertainty in median particle size.
Future work could include full modeling of atmospheres with more complex spatial distributions, grain geometries and compositions.

A similar amplitude versus wavelength trend was recently observed for WISEP J004701.06+680352.1 \citep{2016ApJ...829L..32L}, which has very red ($J-K$ = 2.55) spectral energy distribution thought to be caused by a high altitude haze layer.
In WISEP J0047, the wavelength trend could be fit by $\sim0.4~\mu$m forsterite grains, a few times large than our characteristic particle size.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

We observed two brown dwarfs of spectral type L4-L5: 2MASS 1821 and 2MASS 0835.
These brown dwarfs have temperatures near the condensation temperature of forsterite (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$).
We obtained high precision ground-based spectrophotometry of both systems to measure the variability spectra of these systems with the IRTF.
After fitting sinusoids to both of the time series, we find that 2MASS 0835 has low levels of variability and no significant wavelength dependence.

2MASS J1821 shows significant variability up to the 1.5\% amplitude (3.0\% peak-to-valley) at short wavelengths (0.9$\mu$m) which decreases towards the near infrared (2.4$\mu$m).
This is consistent with HST measurements for the system that show a gradual decrease in variability amplitude with wavelength \citep{2016ApJ...826....8Y} from 1.1$\mu$m to 1.7 $\mu$m with no decrease in the water vapor band.
The lack of the water vapor band gives evidence of a high altitude aerosol layer in the atmosphere.

We fit the variability amplitude spectrum with an optically thin Mie scattering model and find it is consistent with forsterite grains with sub-micron sized particles.
A log-normal particle size distribution fits the data with a median grain radius of 0.24 $^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$ $\mu$m.
Continued ground-based surveys such as with SpeX on IRTF will provide powerful constraints on dust particle sizes in other brown dwarf atmospheres which can have different temperature profiles and cloud altitudes.

\section{Original Light Curves}

We show the original light curves used in model fitting in Figure \ref{fig:tserNoDetrend}.
The original light curves show significant variations as a function of time and airmass.
Our sinusoidal model using Equation \ref{eq:cosfit} is shown for each of the light curves in Figure \ref{fig:tserNoDetrend}.
For \ref{fig:tserDetrend} we remove the fit the baseline variations to show the astrophysical modulations due to brown dwarf rotation.
