\section{Introduction}

Brown dwarfs atmospheres are an intriguing environment to explore cloud composition, particle size and formation that also complement studies of exoplanet atmospheres.
Their temperatures are cool enough that they span condensation points of many cloud-producing  compounds.

The cloud layers may be studied from the direct spectroscopy of a populations of brown dwarf atmospheres \citep[e.g.][]{burgasser2006ltTrans,liu2006}.
In addition to these direct spectroscopy and photometry, brown dwarfs may be observed over their rotation periods to understand the spatial cloud structure and composition, that can change rapidly with time \citep[e.g.][]{yang2016exStormsBD}.
In the case where the targets are bright enough, Doppler imaging can be used to map out the cloud structures on brown dwarfs as in \citet{crossfield2014dopplerimg}.

The photometry brown dwarfs at the L/T transition is explained by (silicate and sulfide?) clouds at a temperature of (?).

L dwarfs are found to be variable with periods of 1-100 hours \citep{bailer-jones1999bdvar,bailer-jones1999varevo}.
This variability is explained by a patchy clouds at the L/T transition \citep{marley2010patchyc}.
Virtually all L dwarfs and most T dwarfs likely have photospheric heterogeneities that cause flux variations larger than 0.2\% in the near infrared \citep{metchev2015weatherII}

\citet{burgaser2014irtf} first demonstrated that the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) was a useful tool for characterizing brown dwarf variability and that a simultaneous reference can be used to correct for common-mode variability, such as telluric transmission variations.
\citet{burgaser2014irtf} observed the binary system Luhman 16 AB and used the more stable Luhman 16A as a simultaneous reference to measure spectral variability in Luhman 16B.

We observed the three brown dwarfs as part of a pilot program to assess the efficacy of IRTF for measuring spectral variability in brown dwarf atmospheres.
2MASS J18212815+1414010 is an L5 brown dwarf showing a triangular H-band spectrum \citep{looper2008peculiarLdwarfs}.
2MASS J1821's short rotation period (4.2 hr) allows for time series spectroscopy for all longitudes in a single ground based observation night.
2MASS J08354256-0819237 \citep{cruz2003coolNeighbors} is also an L5 brown dwarf known to be variable.

\begin{table*}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
Name & Rotation Period & Spectral Type & K magnitude \\
-- & hr & -- & -- \\
\hline \hline
2MASS J1821+14010 & 4.2\footnote{\citet{metchev2015weatherII}} & L4.5 - L5 & 11.14 \\
2MASS J0835-019 & 9 & L5 & 11.65 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table*}


\section{Observations}

For 2MASS J0835, we observed a simultaneous reference - 2MASS 08354383-0819212, $J$=12.74, $H$=12.28, $K_S$=12.19 at a distance of 28 arcsec.
We obtained spectrophotometry over 4.65 hours, covering about half of a rotation period for 2MASS J0835.

We observed 2MASS J1821 and 2MASS J0835 for one night each with the IRTF.
For 2MASS J1821, we observed a simultaneous reference - 2MASS 18212622+1414064, $J$=12.58, $H$=11.97, $K_S$=11.82  at a distance of 24\arcsec.
We were able to measure spectrophotometry over 7.47 hours, which was 1.8 rotations at the 4.2 rotation period from \citet{metchev2015weatherII}.

As visible in Figure \ref{fig:specphot1821}, the light curves for 2MASS J1821 repeat the same fluctuations after one rotation period.
Assuming the brown dwarfs cloud structure was relatively unchanged in one rotation, this enabled confirmation that the signal was astrophysical as opposed to the systematics affecting the same instrument telescope for observations of the  KIC 12557548 system \citep{schlawin2016kic1255}.
%Using MORIS image for distance and plate scale in header of 0.1143 arcsec/px

%Using SpeX Guider image for distance of 241px  and plate scale in header of 0.116 arcsec/px


We use the same method as \citet{schlawin2014} to obtain high precision spectrophotometry.
We used a 0.9~$\mu$m dichoric to split the optical wavelengths to the MORIS imager \citep{Gulbis2011}.
For guiding, we use the MORIS imager in the SDSS $i$ band and 60 second long exposures in order to obtain simultaneous photometry on 2MASS J1821.
For 2MASS J0835, we were unable to obtain photometry - why? due to the fainter source?

\begin{table*}
\begin{center}
\caption{Observing Parameters}\label{tab:obsParam}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
Target & Observing Date & N$_{int}$ & t$_{exp}$ & Reference Star \\
-- & UT Start & -- & (s) & -- \\
\hline
2MASS J1821 & 2015-12-31 & 363 & 45 & 2MASS 18212622+1414064 \\
2MASS J0835 & 2016-06-25 & 352 & 60 & 2MASS 08354383-0819212 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\tablenotetext{}{}
\end{table*}

We observed 2MASS J1821 and J0835 each for one night as part of a pilot program to explore a variety of brown dwarfs with different variability levels and atmospheric temperatures.
Table \ref{tab:obsParam} shows the observing parameters for each target including the integration time, number of integrations and reference star.

Wavelength calibrations were performed with a 0.3$\times$60\arcsec\ slit and an argon emission lamp.
We performed calibrations sequences of argon emission lamp spectra and flat fielding with the 3$\times$60\arcsec\ slit both before and after the brown dwarf time series to obtain information on the flat field and any flexure in the instrument with telescope orientation.

For 2MASS J0835, we use a combination of an incandescent lamp and a sky frame to construct a flat.
Due to flexure and motion with thin the system, we use a sky frame to get the structure of the background with low order polynomials fits in the horizontal direction.
All of the (large $\gtrsim$ 30 px) structure is removed from the lamp frame with low order polynomials, and this residual flat is used to correct the pixel-to-pixel variations while the sky frame is used to measure the larger structures.
We cross-correlate the sky frame with each image to account for any spatial shifts and apply the pixel-to-pixel flat to construct a custom flat field for every image.

For 2MASS J1821, we did not have sufficient sky frames for sky flats so we use an incandescent lamp for flat fielding.
Here, we fit the flat field structure with low order polynomials in the incandescent flat field to describe the spatial structure and use the residual image as a pixel-to-pixel flat.
As in 2MASS J0835, we cross-correlate the spatial structure image to find a shift and then multiply it by the pixel-to-pixel flat to create a custom flat field for every image.
In both 2MASS J0835 and 2MASS J1821 we remove all spectral structure from the flat fields to make ``response'' images that do not include the spectral structure of the lamp or dramatically alter the flux levels that would affect SNR calculations from the number of photo-electrons in a given pixel.

As in \citep{schlawin2016kic1255}, we perform background subtraction over the entire slit with polynomial fit.
We use a 4th order polynomial through all points outside +/-30 pixels of each aperture for the background subtraction.
We use optimal extraction \citep{horne1986optimalE} to maximize the signal to noise.
The spatial profiles are fit with low order polynomials with 20$\sigma$ rejection to remove cosmic rays and bad pixels.

	\label{fig:specphot}
	\vspace{0.1in}
\end{figure*} 

Figure \ref{fig:specphot} shows the dynamic spectra for both brown dwarfs with the individual spectra of the target and reference stars on the upper panels.
At the few percent level, 2MASS j0835 shows no variations or systematics.
2MASS J1821 on the other hand, shows a periodic signal that is strongest at the short wavelength and gradually gets smaller toward longer wavelengths.
2MASS J1821 also exhibits systematic trends near strong slopes in the raw spectra due to telluric absorption bands.

\begin{figure*}[!t]

	\label{fig:tserPhase1821}
	}
	\caption{Phase folded time series for both systems.}
	\label{fig:tserPfold}
\end{figure*} 

2MASS J0835 exhibits no periodic behavior whereas 2MASS 1821 shows large varations when phasing the dynamic spectra at the known rotation periods of the two brown dwarfs, shown in Figure \ref{fig:tserPfold}.
For 2MASS 1821, the variations are mostly sinusoidal and repeat over multiple rotations of the brown dwarf - the exception is wavelengths near telluric features, such as 1.43~$\mu$m and 1.79~$\mu$m.

We fit the time series of each brown dwarf in 25 spectral bins each to assess the wavelength-dependent nature of their variations.
The simple model can be described as 
\begin{equation}
F(t) = A * \sin(2 \pi (t - t_0)/\tau) + B t + C
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the flux as a function of time ($t$), A is the amplitude of the variations, $t_0$ is the time offset of the variations and $\tau$ is the and B and C are linear terms describing the baseline trend.
For the fits, we include a 4 free parameters: $A$, $t_0$, $B$ and $C$.
We fixed the sinusoidal period $\tau$ at the literature value of periodicity because there are also variations due to variable telluric variation that are not relevant to the brown dwarf system.
We imposed a prior that $A \geq 0$ so that a solution with a $\pi$ phase offset and negative amplitude isn't found.

\end{figure*} 

Figure \ref{fig:ampSpec} shows the best fit amplitudes as a function of wavelength.
We use the standard deviation of points near minimum to estimate the noise in the flux time series.
The Levenberg-Marquardt chi-squared minimization code \texttt{mpfit} is used to fit each wavelength bin independently and propagate the errors in the flux time series to amplitude uncertainty.
The amplitude spectrum of 2MASS J0835 shown in Figure \ref{fig:ampspec0835} shows random fluctuations as a function of wavelength.
2MASS J1821, on the other hand, shows a clear decreasing trend as function of wavelength.
This was also observed in the shorter wavelength range of 1.1~$\mu$m to 1.7~$\mu$m in \citet{yang2016exStormsBD}.

\section{Simple Model Fits}

We model the wavelength dependence of 2MASS 1821 as an optically thin cloud layer consisting of a log-normal distribution of particle sizes.
In this simple model, the amplitude of the variability is directly proportional to the opacity or $Q_{ext}$ of the particles.
We model the extinction coefficient from the \texttt{IDL} Mie theory code \texttt{mie\_single.pro} \citep{grainger04} to calculate the extinction as a function of wavelength.
We use the complex indices of refraction from \citet{dorschner95pyrox} for Mg-rich pyroxene grains.
For the particle size distribution we assume a log-normal distribution around a characteristic size with a distribution $\sigma$ of 0.5.

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{amp_vs_wavl_j1821_mie_sc.pdf}
\caption{Sine fit amplitude versus wavelength excluding the regions contaminated by telluric absorption. with simple Mie scattering models with a log-normal particle size distribution centered at 0.1 and 0.2~$\mu$m}\label{fig:ampspec1821mie}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ampspec1821mie} shows the simple Mie scattering model as compared to the data for two example particle sizes of 0.1~$\mu$m and 0.2~$\mu$m.
In these cases the reduced chi-squared values are 9.6 and 2.5 respectively, when ignoring the points within the shaded telluric contamination regions.

\citet{yang2015hstRotBD} also observe wavelength-dependent variability of 2MASS J1821 with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) Wide Field Camera (WFC3) over 2 visits of 3 orbits each.
Their maximum over minimum flux spectrum is converted to an amplitude spectrum by assuming that the amplitude is half the difference in maximum and minimum flux, which can be shown to be 
\begin{equation}
A  = \frac{f_R - 1}{f_R + 1}
\end{equation}
where $f_R$ is the flux ratio of the maximum over minimum flux.

The WFC3 amplitude spectrum is shown with the data in Figure \ref{fig:ampspec1821mie}.
There is a multiplicative offset between the IRTF and WFC3 spectrum because they were taken at different epochs and therefore different spatial cloud and temperature distributions.
The WFC3 spectrum is not affected by the telluric absorption the way the SpeX data is.
\citet{yang2015hstRotBD} find that the WFC3 spectrum has no significant water vapor absorption which indicates a high haze layer in 2MASS J1821, consistent with our Mie scattering fit.

%% each one.

%% Two options are available to the author for producing tables:  the
%% deluxetable environment provided by the AASTeX package or the LaTeX
%% table environment.  Use of deluxetable is preferred.
%%

%% Three table samples follow, two marked up in the deluxetable environment,
%% one marked up as a LaTeX table.

%% In this first example, note that the \tabletypesize{}
%% command has been used to reduce the font size of the table.
%% We also use the \rotate command to rotate the table to
%% landscape orientation since it is very wide even at the
%% reduced font size.
%%
%% Note also that the \label command needs to be placed
%% inside the \tablecaption.

%% This table also includes a table comment indicating that the full
%% version will be available in machine-readable format in the electronic
%% edition.

%% If you use the table environment, please indicate horizontal rules using
%% \tableline, not \hline.
%% Do not put multiple tabular environments within a single table.
%% The optional \label should appear inside the \caption command.



%% If the table is more than one page long, the width of the table can vary
%% from page to page when the default \tablewidth is used, as below.  The
%% individual table widths for each page will be written to the log file; a
%% maximum tablewidth for the table can be computed from these values.
%% The \tablewidth argument can then be reset and the file reprocessed, so
%% that the table is of uniform width throughout. Try getting the widths
%% from the log file and changing the \tablewidth parameter to see how
%% adjusting this value affects table formatting.

%% The \dataset{} macro has also been applied to a few of the objects to
%% show how many observations can be tagged in a table.


%% Tables may also be prepared as separate files. See the accompanying
%% sample file table.tex for an example of an external table file.
%% To include an external file in your main document, use the \input
%% command. Uncomment the line below to include table.tex in this
%% sample file. (Note that you will need to comment out the \documentclass,
%% \begin{document}, and \end{document} commands from table.tex if you want
%% to include it in this document.)

%% \input{table}

%% The following command ends your manuscript. LaTeX will ignore any text
%% that appears after it.

\end{document}

%%
%% End of file `sample.tex'.
